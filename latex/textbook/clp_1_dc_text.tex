\section*{Issues to be sorted}
\begin{itemize}
\item Painful --- check punctuation of all equations.
\item run a spell checker. We using ise or ize? factorise vs factorize. metre vs
meter. centre vs center? --- have run it through a spell checker.. Lets use
British - so centre, metre, factorise.

\item Should units be in mathrm or normal text or maths or ?

\item Unbelievably important --- replace equation environment by align?

\item Problem with 2 footnotes in Def0.3.6. First has wrong hyperref while
second jumps correctly. Simple fix = turn of hyperrefs to footnotes.

\item Should we define ``neighbourhood'' somewhere? We can then update a few
definitions and theorems. The only problem with this is that we never actually
specify the precise neighbourhood in theorems --- just that there is one. Will
this confuse students? Can we do this in a way that wont confuse anyone? Or is
it better to just leave it be.

\item Put in some ``asymptotes'' --- vertical ones around limits that blow up to
infinity, and horizontal ones around limits at infinity.

\item How early can we move the MVT? Can we move it to.... before exponentials
and trig?

\item Try to add a real (optional) proof or Rolle (at end of mvt section) ---
we can try. Ruffly --- leave as a ``fact'' that a continuous function on a
closed bounded interval reaches its max and min (with refs to how this is
actually proved and that it is false on the rationals). Then the rest is doable.
Also how Rolle proves MVT.

\item Blurb on radiactive decay at start of app. $\checkmark$

\item Add more items to list at start of applications?

\item Do we care that Example~\ref{eg:velaccelA} is kinda using MVT? or is this obvious.
I think we don't care \checkmark

\item Population models. Make logistic stuff into an optional section (with
some indication that we are really introducing DEs and that to solve them
properly we need integrals (next term!). Then have simple malthus model as the
start of this chaptah (as JF has done) with  some blurb about when malthus is a
decent model (ie when pop is small compared to size of system). \checkmark

\item Should function be differentiable at critical point? or is it anywhere the
derivative could change sign? $\sqrt{|x|}$ for example? We should make critical point =
point where derivative is zero. Singular point = point where derivative does not exist.
Students should understand both and we need to update our max/min hunting to reflect the
change.

\item Add a few more simple optimisation word problems (eg --- crossing a
river, or a pool --- run or swim. Building a cube with fixed surface area.)

\item Have put in a quick ``summation notation'' stuff from Joel's notes. This might need
to be bulked out a little and should we use it more in the rest of the taylor section?
 See Section 2 (starting on page 5) of
\url{http://www.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/m101/intDef.pdf} \checkmark

\item Where do we first define factorial? We redefine it several times.

\item Do we need blurb around definition~\ref{def:APPrelError}

\item For taylor error in linear approx - we need the MVT. But in the course
(2015) we do MVT afterwards (due to stewart legacy). So in the current text
write something like ``If you have not seen the MVT then just accept this is
the error. If you have seen MVT --- this is exactly MVT and here is why.'' Fix
this in later version of things.

\item Fix extra long headers that overlap with other bits of headers (eg AppB3) \checkmark

\item Look at compile log and fix referencing errors - a few are multiply
defined and there are undefined refs too. Hopefully nothing too serious.

\item Put some simple antiderivatives stuff in.

\item Consider making root finding an optional section. We have the raw notes.
\item Consider adding material to section 0.6 (or elsewhere)
    concerning graphing inverse functions.
