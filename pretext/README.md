# CLP-1 PreTexT source files
* The text and problem sets were originally written as separate texts in latex.
* In order to provide a good online text we translated the latex into  [pretext](https://pretextbook.org/) xml.
* The resulting pretext sources compile into a combined text with exercises.


## Compilation instructions
* The pretext source files can be compiled into html and PDF.
* More details coming soon

## Figure files
* In order to compile the pretext into both html and pdf, the figures have been saved as both svg and pdf.
* See the latex sources for information on how they were produced.
